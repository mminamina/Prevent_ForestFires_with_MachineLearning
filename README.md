## Prevent ForestFires with MachineLearning

There have been terrifying forest fires in California where I live. I am passionate about building better society together with data science and artificial intelligence. The notebooks illustrate how to predict and prevent forest fires with machine learning. The notebooks explain and implement different techniques of handling imbalanced dataset and comparison of multiple models to make predictions more robust.
